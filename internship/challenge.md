# Intership Challenge

- [ ] choose one or more of these public APIs - https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis.
- [ ] create a simple command line interface to access this api (I recommend to use [yargs](https://github.com/yargs/yargs))
- [ ] it should use **fetch** to request data from an API
- [ ] it should be open sourced on your github repo

Example of usage:

`./metaweather-cli "SÃ£o Paulo"`
